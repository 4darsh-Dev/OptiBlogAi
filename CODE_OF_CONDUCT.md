## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please notify the community leaders as soon as possible through one of these channels:

**Primary Contact**: Project Maintainer (4darsh-Dev)
- GitHub: [@4darsh-Dev](https://github.com/4darsh-Dev)
- Email: [Report via GitHub Issues](https://github.com/solve-ease/OptiBlogAi/issues) (for non-sensitive matters)

**For sensitive reports** (harassment, discrimination, etc.):
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- Contact maintainers directly through private channels
- If you're uncomfortable contacting project maintainers directly, you may report to GitHub Trust & Safety

### What to Include in a Report

When reporting an incident, please include:

* **Description**: What happened and when
* **Location**: Where the incident occurred (which platform, repository, etc.)
* **Participants**: Who was involved (use usernames/handles when possible)
* **Evidence**: Screenshots, links, or other documentation (if available)
* **Impact**: How this affected you or others
* **Previous incidents**: Any related previous behavior (if applicable)
* **Preferred resolution**: What outcome you're hoping for (if you have a preference)

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality. We will only share
information about the incident with those who need to know in order to investigate
and respond appropriately.

We will not retaliate against anyone who reports an incident in good faith, and we
will not tolerate retaliation by community members.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at the contact
information listed above.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of the report within 48 hours
2. **Initial review**: Community leaders will review the report and determine next steps
3. **Investigation**: We may gather additional information from involved parties
4. **Decision**: Community leaders will determine appropriate consequences
5. **Communication**: We will communicate the outcome to the reporter and (when appropriate) the community

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of
actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent
ban.

#### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

### Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you may appeal the decision by:

1. **Submitting an appeal** within 30 days of the enforcement action
2. **Providing additional context** or evidence that wasn't considered
3. **Requesting review** by a different community leader (if possible)

Appeals should be sent to the same contact channels used for reporting, clearly
marked as "Code of Conduct Appeal."
