## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of OptiBlogAi:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| main    | ✅ Yes             |
| 1.x.x   | ✅ Yes             |
| < 1.0   | ❌ No              |

**Note**: As this is an early-stage open source project, we currently focus security support on the main branch and stable releases. We recommend always using the latest stable version.

## Security Considerations

### AI and LLM-Specific Security Risks

OptiBlogAi's AI-powered nature introduces unique security considerations:

#### 1. **LLM API Security**
- **API key exposure**: Groq, Gemini, and other API keys must be protected
- **Rate limiting**: Prevent abuse of third-party AI services
- **Input validation**: Sanitize prompts to prevent injection attacks
- **Output validation**: Verify generated content for malicious or harmful material

#### 2. **Content Security**
- **Prompt injection**: Malicious prompts designed to manipulate AI behavior
- **Data leakage**: Preventing training data or sensitive information exposure
- **Content integrity**: Ensuring generated content hasn't been maliciously altered
- **Copyright concerns**: Avoiding generation of copyrighted material

#### 3. **Web Scraping Security**
- **SSRF attacks**: Server-Side Request Forgery through malicious URLs
- **XSS prevention**: Sanitizing scraped content to prevent script injection
- **Rate limiting**: Respecting robots.txt and avoiding aggressive scraping
- **DNS rebinding**: Protecting against internal network access

### Traditional Security Risks

#### 1. **Authentication and Authorization**
- API endpoint security
- Access control for administrative functions
- Session management for web interfaces

#### 2. **Input Validation**
- SQL injection prevention
- Command injection prevention
- Path traversal protection
- File upload security

#### 3. **Infrastructure Security**
- Container security (Docker)
- Dependency management
- Environment configuration
- Network security

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### API Key Management
```bash
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables
export GROQ_API_KEY="your-key-here"
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoding in source code
api_key = "gsk_1234567890abcdef"  # Never do this!
```

#### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Create secure .env file
cp .env.example .env
chmod 600 .env  # Restrict file permissions
```

#### Docker Security
```bash
# Run container as non-root user
docker run --user 1000:1000 optiblogai

# Limit container capabilities
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE optiblogai
```

### For Developers

#### Input Validation
```python
# ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize inputs
def validate_keyword(keyword: str) -> str:
    if not keyword or len(keyword) > 100:
        raise ValueError("Invalid keyword")
    # Remove potentially dangerous characters
    return re.sub(r'[^\w\s-]', '', keyword)

# ❌ Bad: Using inputs directly
def scrape_content(url):
    return requests.get(url)  # Vulnerable to SSRF
```

#### Safe Content Processing
```python
# ✅ Good: Sanitize scraped content
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import bleach

def clean_content(html_content: str) -> str:
    # Parse with BeautifulSoup
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')
    text = soup.get_text()
    
    # Sanitize with bleach
    return bleach.clean(text, strip=True)
```

#### Secure LLM Integration
```python
# ✅ Good: Validate prompts and responses
def generate_content(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Validate input prompt
    if len(prompt) > MAX_PROMPT_LENGTH:
        raise ValueError("Prompt too long")
    
    # Sanitize prompt to prevent injection
    sanitized_prompt = sanitize_prompt(prompt)
    
    # Generate content
    response = llm_client.generate(sanitized_prompt)
    
    # Validate and filter response
    return validate_generated_content(response)
```

### Dependency Management

#### Keep Dependencies Updated
```bash
# Regular security updates
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Check for known vulnerabilities
pip-audit

# Use dependabot for automated updates
```

#### Pin Versions
```txt
# requirements.txt - Pin to specific versions
beautifulsoup4==4.13.3
fastapi==0.104.1
groq==0.4.1
```
