# Ethical Guidelines for OptiBlogAi

## Introduction

OptiBlogAi is committed to ethical AI development and responsible content generation. These guidelines establish our principles for developing and using AI-powered content generation systems. We believe transparency, accountability, and respect for intellectual property are essential for responsible innovation.

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency in AI-Generated Content
- All content produced by OptiBlogAi must include a clear disclosure that it was AI-assisted:
  ```
  Disclosure: This article was created with AI assistance. The content has been reviewed and edited by human professionals to ensure accuracy and quality.
  ```
- Never represent AI-generated content as purely human-authored
- Provide visibility into content generation sources when requested

### 2. Respect for Content Sources
- Strictly adhere to `robots.txt` directives on all scraped websites
- Never circumvent paywalls or access restrictions
- Limit scraping frequency to avoid overloading servers (max 1 request/5 seconds per domain)
- Cache scraped content for maximum 30 days unless otherwise specified by source
- Implement the following ethical scraping practices:

  ```python
  # Example ethical scraping implementation
  from urllib.robotparser import RobotFileParser
  
  def can_scrape(url, user_agent="OptiBlogAi"):
      rp = RobotFileParser()
      rp.set_url(f"{url.scheme}://{url.netloc}/robots.txt")
      rp.read()
      return rp.can_fetch(user_agent, url)
  ```

### 3. Original Content Generation
- Generated content must pass plagiarism checks with â‰¥95% originality
- Implement multi-stage similarity detection:
  1. Direct phrase matching (avoiding >7 consecutive matching words)
  2. Semantic similarity analysis (threshold: <80% similarity)
  3. Manual sample review process
- Cite sources when directly referencing facts or statistics

### 4. Human Oversight and Control
- Always maintain human editorial control points:
  - Keyword input approval
  - Content assessment review
  - Final publication authorization
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms for:
  - Specific domains to exclude from scraping
  - Content removal requests
  - Personal data deletion

### 5. Data Privacy and Security
- Never collect personal information during scraping
- Encrypt all stored content using AES-256 encryption
- Implement strict access controls for generated content
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations
- Automatically purge user data after 30 days of inactivity

### 6. Bias Mitigation
- Implement regular bias audits on generated content
- Maintain diverse training data sources
- Provide content diversity scoring in outputs
- Include explicit prompts to reduce bias:
  ```
  When generating content, ensure balanced representation across:
  - Gender perspectives
  - Cultural contexts
  - Socioeconomic backgrounds
  - Geographical regions
  ```

### 7. Accountability Framework
- Maintain detailed generation logs for 90 days
- Implement a redress system for content disputes
- Provide clear attribution for scraped components
- Establish an ethics review board for controversial cases

## Implementation Standards

### Content Assessment Ethics
```python
def ethical_assessment(content):
    """Run content through ethical validation checks"""
    checks = {
        "plagiarism": check_plagiarism(content),
        "bias_score": calculate_bias_score(content),
        "fact_check": run_fact_checking(content),
        "disclosure_present": "AI-assisted" in content.footer
    }
    
    if not all(checks.values()):
        raise ContentEthicsViolation("Content failed ethical standards")
    
    return apply_seo_optimization(content)
```

### Prohibited Content Types
OptiBlogAi must never generate:
- Medical/health advice claiming diagnostic capability
- Financial predictions or investment advice
- Legal interpretations or contract templates
- Political propaganda or election-related messaging
- Content targeting minors
- Defamatory or harassing material

## Enforcement and Compliance

1. **Automated Checks**: All content passes through ethical validation gates
2. **Manual Review**: 10% of generated content undergoes human ethics review
3. **Audit Trail**: Maintain cryptographically signed logs of all content operations
4. **Reporting**: Publish quarterly transparency reports detailing:
   - Content generation volumes
   - Plagiarism incident rates
   - Source exclusion requests
   - Ethics violation resolutions

## Reporting Concerns

To report ethical concerns:
1. Open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OptiBlogAi/Blog-AI/issues) with label "ethics"
2. Email ethics@OptiBlogAi.dev with detailed report
3. Use the `/report` endpoint in our API:
   ```
   POST /v1/ethics/report
   {
     "content_id": "UUID",
     "concern_type": ["plagiarism", "bias", "disclosure", "other"],
     "description": "Detailed explanation of concern"
   }
   ```

All reports will receive:
- Initial response within 72 hours
- Full investigation within 14 days
- Public resolution summary (when appropriate)

## Continuous Improvement

These guidelines will be:
- Reviewed quarterly by the ethics board
- Updated with community input via RFC process
- Versioned with semantic versioning (e.g., Ethics v1.2.0)
- Audited annually by independent third parties
